# Shopping Cart
A Shopping Website which can add and remove items to the cart with the help of Redux toolkit for state management.

Note - When viewed in the small device(smartphone) there is a UI problem in that some of the items when added to the cart gets overflowed from items div. This will be fixed in the future.
Also if you are interested and want to fix it:
- Clone the repository
- Make a side branch and fix it 
- Send a push request from your side branch.

Happy coding :)
